## **Setup instructions**

____

Download the release as a zip file containing all the code, and extract it to the desired folder.
Do NOT tamper with the structure of folders and files once extracted or their names, which would break the program. Tampering with the speeches .txt file with non-unicode characters may also hinder the bot's capacities.

Once done, launch the program by running __<u>main.py</u>__ in any python console interpreter. You may now interact with the program :)

## **App description**

____

This ChatBot for now essentially consists of a handful of 6 functionalities analyzing investiture speeches of the last 6 French presidents :

- Least important words;
- Words with the highest TF-IDF score (the rarest);
- The most repeated words by president Chirac;
- Names of president who mentions the word nation, and the president who mentions it the most;
- The first president talking about climate in his speech;
- Words which all president mentioned in their speeches.

Mind before each new input that there is a 5s~ cooldown before each command to allow you to read the answer of the bot, be patient !
